This dataset and the emission factors within it relate to 1kg of tyre wear.

Non-exhaust emissions are considered to be linearly scalable to gross vehicle weight (GVW). For tyre wear emissions from lorries the specific quantity is 8.055E-8 kg/kg GVW*km. 

The GVW of the 3.5-7.5t lorries using an average load factor is 4984kg.

The value calculated must then be devided by the average load to give the non-exhaust emissions per tkm."
